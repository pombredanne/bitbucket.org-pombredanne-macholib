-------------

macholib 1.4 is a feature release

Features:

- Documentation is now generated using `sphinx <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx>`_
  and can be viewed at <http://packages.python.org/macholib>.

- The repository has moved to bitbucket

- There now is a testsuite

- Private functionality inside modules was renamed to
  a name starting with an underscore. 

  .. note:: if this change affects your code you are relying on undefined
     implementation features, please stop using private functions.

- The basic packable types in ``macholib.ptypes`` were renamed to better
  represent the corresponding C type. The table below lists the old

  ``Macholib.ptypes.p_ptr`` is no longer present as it had an unclear 
  definition and isn't actually used in the codebase.


Bug fixes:

- The source distribution includes all files, this was broken
  due to the switch to mercurial (which confused setuptools)
